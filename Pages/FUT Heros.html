                <p>Some heroes start young and fade away. Others only make their mark later on. Landon Donovan took the reins at his very first FIFA World Cup™ and never looked back. There the young American, just 20 years old, stood tall against his team’s arch enemy and headed in the goal to defeat Mexico and launch the US into the semi-finals.</p>

                <p>By the time an attacking player decided how they would try to attack Ricardo Carvalho, they had already lost. They just didn’t know it yet. The Portuguese’s amazing sense of anticipation allowed him to thwart even the most impressive offensive attack. He knew what his opponents were going to do before they did, and he never gave them a chance</p>

                <p>Any hero can amaze us with physical gifts that make them better than everyone else. The greatest heroes inspire us to be better ourselves. There is no more perfect example than Claudio Marchisio. As a midfielder, his ability to coolly adapt to any situation combined with the skill and will to turn any possession into an opportunity to run, shoot, and score gave Juventus a legendary midfield. </p>

                <p>Like the legendary Colossus of Rhodes, Yaya Touré only had to stand on the pitch to inspire fear and awe in all who saw the size of the mighty midfield mountain. In 2011/12 he helped Manchester City hoist their first Premier League title in 44 long years. That season may be remembered for a certain Argentine striker’s historic last minute goal to win the league, but the influential Ivorian scored both goals in the game prior to keep their title hopes alive. </p>

                <p>Foes who fail to foil his relentless attacks or avoid his persistent pressing claim he has three lungs. Those who fail to escape his merciless marking insist he has two hearts. But the truth of Park Ji-Sung is far more heroic. Inside him beats the heart of a tiger. He not only has the ceaseless stamina to go all out all game, but he also has the tiger’s instinct for the perfect time to strike. Often that moment comes late when an opponent is exhausted, worn out, and has nothing left.</p>

When the lights are brightest and everyone else is overwhelmed, the hero you need is Diego Forlán. 2010 alone showed that the fearless Forlán would always rise to the occasion.</p>

                <p>Some defenders sit and wait. Some guess and scheme. Then there was Lúcio, who brought the lightning. Fast, physical, and known for his thundering runs, he terrified foes with his tough-tackling style and endless energy. He heroically played every minute of Brazil’s 2002 FIFA World Cup™ championship run to help his nation become the first country to win the tournament five times. Beyond his 105 caps for his country, Lúcio brought his relentless storm to some of Europe’s biggest teams</p>

His heroics for his country over the course of over 20 years make him a beacon of Mexican football, where the elegant defender played in a fantastic five FIFA World Cup™  tournaments. Even at a young age, his legendary leadership was clear, being named national team captain at just 23 - and going on to wear the armband in a record five separate FIFA World Cup™ tournaments.</p>

                <p>You can’t always measure a hero by their size or stature. Javier Mascherano is living proof of that. Foolish strikers might have looked across the pitch at the tiny Argentine and dreamed of easy goals. Soon they’d discover that his boundless energy, tenacious commitment, and tough tackling make him an attacker’s nightmare. He played like a man with extra feet, shutting down every attack and regaining each possession to start a crushing counter.</p>

                <h1>PETER CROUCH</h1>
                <p>Some heroes scale skyscrapers. Peter Crouch was one. “A good touch for a big man” was the observation that followed the 2-metre-tall striker throughout a career that took him all over English football. Crouch had the size and skill that made it seem like he was the result of a heroic effort to construct the perfect footballer in a lab. He was a menace to defenders with both his feet - which had a knack for the spectacular, and his head - which holds the Premier League record for headed goals.</p>

                <p>It’s when things look darkest, hope is fading, and people are ready to give up that we most need heroes. The darker, more hopeless, and more depressing the situation, the more Dirk Kuyt is the hero you need. He will light up the room, fill you with hope, and empower you with his eclectic enthusiasm. Ask fans of any team Dirk Kuyt has ever played for, and they’ll speak of him in glowing terms. He played football with a full-throttle commitment, channelling a seemingly infinite amount of energy and excitement that energised teammates and fans alike.</p>

                <h1>HARRY KEWELL</h1>
                <p>Most young heroes begin as sidekicks, taking their time to grow and learn before becoming full fledged heroes. Nobody was going to make Harry Kewell wait. He was a wunderkind whose magic was undeniable from the moment Leeds offered him a trial at just fifteen. A magic man with the ball at his feet, his perfectly precise ball control mystified defenders right from the start. In 2000 he earned the PFA Young Player of the Year award, followed by mesmerising displays in 2000/01 that helped his club reach the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League.</p>

                <p>Ordinary strikers see a pass as too off target, a deflection as too far away, or a cross as too high. Jean-Pierre Papin saw every ball in the box, or sometimes even near the box, as an opportunity for the spectacular. He converted ordinary opportunities like the most ruthless of strikers, but was a specialist in the impossible. The harder the ball was to reach, the more he effortlessly twisted and turned his body like an acrobat to not only meet it but then somehow drive it powerfully into the back of the net.</p>

The lionhearted winger led OL to every league triumph in their history, winning seven straight to catapult his childhood club to the upper echelons of French football. He roared onto the European stage in 2001 with two ferocious strikes in the UEFA Champions League, then again on the world stage with a spark of inspiration in the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ knockouts against Spain. </p>

Brolin’s speed and agility made him like a whirlwind with the ball at his feet, helping him to score the decisive goal in Parma’s 1-0 victory in the 1991/1992 Coppa Italia semi-final on their way to the club’s first ever trophy.</p>

                <p>When defenders looked up to see The Flying German’s instantly recognisable flowing golden hair flying past them, they knew it was already too late. Völler was a clinical striker with the record to match, picking up the Bundesliga top goalscorer and Footballer of the Year award in 1982/83. His impressive 47 goals in 90 caps for his nation included him lifting the FIFA World Cup™ trophy in 1990, with three goals in the tournament and a place in the starting XI for the final. </p>

                <p>Hidetoshi Nakata looks every bit the hero. But it’s the moment when you realise you aren’t looking at him, when he has somehow slipped away, that he’s at his most dangerous. Like a stealthy super spy, the attacking midfielder would somehow secretly sneak away from his defenders. Then he’d suddenly surface to either take the shot himself or slip a perfect pass to set up a teammate. His stylish talent convinced Parma to make him the most expensive Asian footballer ever, then the agile agent showed he was more than worth it in the first leg final of the Coppa Italia when he snuck into the box against Juventus to score a vital scissor kick.</p>

                <p>Being a hero isn’t easy. But watch Jay-Jay Okocha play, and he might just fool you. One of African football’s best-ever players, he was a true entertainer on the pitch. Of course, maybe the secret to playing with such style and cool nonchalance is knowing that you’ve always got another trick or five-star skill hidden up your sleeve. The most expensive African footballer ever when he joined Paris Saint-Germain in 1998, Okocha was mesmerising in Nigeria’s impressive opening win against Spain in the 1998 FIFA World Cup™ when he grabbed the spotlight of the world’s biggest stage and revealed his incredible talent to the world.</p>

The marauding fullback charged down attackers and bounded forward to support his teammates because nothing was going to keep this hero from being wherever he might be needed. And nothing better demonstrates his commitment to not only being where he was needed but heroically being there whenever he was needed more than the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ where he played every single minute on Spain’s road to international glory.</p>

They would think they had him lined up, and he’d be gone. They’d try to press him, and he’d have shifted by them like they weren’t even there. They’d believe they’d finally trapped him in the corner, only for him to shift things around and reveal that he had them right where he wanted them.</p>

Spotting his target while still inside his own half, he flew past five defenders and smashed the ball past the keeper.</p>
